Gaze estimation software for Unity games

The Brain Game Center at the University of California, Riverside develops brain training games in Unity for the improvement of memory, vision, hearing, attention, and cognition. Our software aims to approximate user engagement during gameplay to enhance training outcomes. A key metric of user engagement is determined by estimating where oneâ€™s gaze is directed while they play. Gaze estimation is an application of computer vision technology that captures images from a user-facing camera to predict where one is looking. Gaze Estimator is an implementation of gaze estimation algorithms for use in Unity. Gaze estimation data collected by Gaze Estimator provides researchers and developers at the UCR Brain Game Center with an actionable means to inform their game development strategy. This presentation details the design considerations and methodologies employed in the development of our gaze estimation software. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84686083/161401541-7304c49e-8db5-4674-954e-30396ea03ba7.png)
